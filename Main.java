Q1: One of the goals of multi-threading
is to minimize the resource usage, such
as memory and processor cycles. In three
sentences, explain how multi-threaded
code accomplishes this goal. Consider
writing about blocking on I/O, multicore 
machines, how sluggish humans are,
threads compared to processes, etcetera,
and connect these issues to 
multi-threading.

Multi-threading minimizes resource usage by allowing concurrent 
execution on multicore machines, efficiently utilizing processor 
cycles as threads share the same memory space, unlike processes 
which require separate memory allocations. By splitting tasks, 
threads can process independent data simultaneously, reducing 
time during I/O operations. Compared to processes, threads are 
lightweight, reducing memory and optimizing performance for
 computationally intensive tasks.
